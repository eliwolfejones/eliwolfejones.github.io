			<p class="albumdesc">From Me To You was the first album that really saw Quadeca in the start of his musical transformation.
				This album uses a theme of climbing a snowy mountain and the metaphors about challenges that that it symbolizes through
				the visuals that accompany it and songs like Sisyphus and Alone Together.</p>

				<img src="idmthy.jpg" alt="I Didn't Mean To Haunt You Album Cover">
			<p class="albumdesc">
				I Didn't Mean To Haunt You represented Quadeca's full transition into experimental and alternative music. It follows a story about a ghost who is stuck in a purgatory in between life and death and the regrets about what he should have done during his life. This is reflected throught the visuals and songs compiled in the album such as Born Yesterday and Fractions of Infinity.
