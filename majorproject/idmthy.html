			<p>I Didn't Mean To Haunt You was the project that demonstrated his full transformation adn showed what
				Quadeca as an artist was capable of. It told a story about a ghost who had commited suicide but instead
				of going to the afterlife he is stuck in a purgatory where he witnesses the affects of his death on
				people close to him. "Fantasyworld" serves as a prequel which shows his thoughts before his passing. He
				is forced to witness lives and people and their experiences without him leading to a reflection on his
				life and the regrets he has but also eventually the frusteration due to some of his family trying not to
				think about his death which he sees as disrespectful. This frusteration and sadness turns causes him to
				show signs that he is there but he gets reckless through his frusteration and he unintentionally turns
				up the stove releasing carbon monoxide which Danny Brown does lyrics for on "House Settling" which
				causes his mother to also pass. The conclusion of the album leads him to finally pass into a world
				beyond as he confesses to his mother everything that has been on his consious including how she passed.
