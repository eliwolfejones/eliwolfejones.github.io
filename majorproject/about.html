		<div class="aboutdesc">
		<p>Quadeca, born Benjamin Lasky, is an American singer, songwriter, and producer. He first gained
			popularity through his YouTube channel, where he posted music reviews and original songs. Over time, Quadeca
			transitioned from being primarily a YouTuber to a full-time musician, releasing several albums and singles
			that showcase his versatility and talent in the hip-hop genre. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When releasing From Me To You he expereimented with new sounds different from his signature rep style. After positive feedback to this
			expereimental sound he created his purly experimental indie album I Didn't Mean To Haunt You showing his
			versatility and potential in this new genre. Scrapyard was another example of how his skill spans multiple
			genres and he also collabed with people in those genres showing his dynamic with other artists that don't
			solely rap. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Before releasing Vanisher, Horizon Scraper he collaborated with a lot more artists who were
			interested in his experimental sound further expanding and exposing his expertise. This was once again shown
			in his latest album Vanisher, Horizon Scraper where he pushed the boundaries of his musical talent further.
