			<p>Vanisher, Horizon Scraper is Quadeca's latest album, it continues to explore his experimental sound and
				further develop a new style. It is also the first of his own albums released under his independent label. The story follows a sailor that decides to sail off away from everything
				and find a new purpose. In search of this purpose he uses things like drugs as a lens to distract him
				from the problems he ran away from. Eventually he almost reaches his purpose but at this time it is too
				late, he has devolved into insanity and paranoia causing him to see things like a mythical creature
				called the Bakunawa which is voiced by Danny Brown on the 12th track, it is questioned if he is
				hallucinating because he has lost his mind. Eventually he meets his inevitable fate where he dies from
				the harsh conditions in the vast ocean which is narrated by Harry Wilkinson of the band Maruja on the final track, his death is also forshadowed
				throughout the album.</p>
