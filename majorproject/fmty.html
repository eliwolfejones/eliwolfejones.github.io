			<p>From Me To You was the first album thay he strayed away from his sound a bit and experiment with a new
				one. The album uses a theme of a mountain as he uses his lyrics to talk about challenges such as
				relationships and being an artist and the affects that all of these things have on himself. The first
				track "Sisyphus" is the track that highlights this mountain the most obviously referencing the greek
				myht about the king of Corinth named Sisyphus was condemned by Zeus to push a boulder up a mountain
				which is an impossible task as the boulder just to rolls back down. This myth symbolises the problems
				that Quadeca talks abiut in his other songs because they seem impossible as well as the fact that a
				mountain itself can be a metaphor for the things people experience in their life.</p>
