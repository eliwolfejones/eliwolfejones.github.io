			<p> Scrapyard was a compilation of songs that Quadeca made which he believed didn't fit his previous and
				future albums I Didn't Mean To Haunt You and Vanisher, Horizon Scraper. He released this album in packs
				seperated by 2 or 3 weeks. This began with his Scrapyard I featuring "YOU DON"T KNOW ME LIKE THAT" and
				"A LA CARTE" which features Brakence. Scrapyard II released the songs "DUSTCUTTER," "UNDER MY SKIN," and
				"I MAKE IT LOOK EFFORTLESS." Scrapyard III released "EVEN IF I TRIED," "EASIER," and "GUESS WHO." There
				was meant to be a fourth and fifth but they got delayed and he release the full album a few months
				later. These featured some of his most ambitious songs which made fans surprised as to why he didn't
				feature them on any of his bigger, anticipated projects. It was also the first time he started working
				with Kevin Abstract on the song "Texas Blue" which sparked a great future between the two.</p>
