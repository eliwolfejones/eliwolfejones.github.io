            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make Dough
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl whisk the yeast and sugar into warm water. Cover and sit for 1 minute</li>
                        <li>Whisk in melted butter and salt.</li>
                        <li>Add 3 cups flour and mix with a wooden spoon or dough hook in a standard mixer until combined.</li>
                        <li>Add &frac34; cup more flour until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If it's still stick add up to &frac14; cup more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
                        <li>Poke dough with your finger, if it bounces back it's ready to knead.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Knead Dough
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep dough in a mixer and beat for 3 to 5 full minutes, or knead by hand.</li>
                        <li>If dough becomes too sticky during kneading sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or the work surface. Don't use too much flour or the dough will become too dry.</li>
                        <li>Do poke test again, if it slowly bounces back it is ready to rise.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li> Shape Dough
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shape dough into a ball.</li>
                        <li>Cover lightly with a towel and allow to rest for 10 to 30 minutes. In the mean time you could make baking soda bath in step 5.</li>
                        <li>Cut dough into 75g sections, which is about 1/3 cupo of dough each.</li>
                        <li>Roll dough into a 20-22 inch rope.</li>
                        <li>Form a circle with the dough by bringing the 2 ends together at the top of the circle.</li>
                        <li>Twist the ends together.</li>
                        <li>Bring the twisted ends back down towards yourself and press them down to form a pretzel shape.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Baking Soda Bath
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add baking soda and 9 cups of water in a large pot</li>
                        <li>Bring to a boil.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Add Pretzels to bath
                    <ol>
                        <li>Drop 1-2 pretzels into baking soda bath for 20-30 seconds. Any longer and your pretzels will have a metallic taste.</li>
                        <li>Using a slotted spatula or spoon, remove pretzel from bath, allow excess water to drip off and place on prepared baking sheet.</li>
                        <li> Sprinkle the top with coarse salt.</li>
                        <li>Repeat with remaining pretzels.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Bake for 13-15 minutes until golden brown.</li>
