    <h1>Code Log 5: Images</h1>

            There are multiple ways of putting images on a web page. Using HTML to put an image using the
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is
            different from using the CSS property <code>background-image</code>. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag embeds
            an image
            onto the web page
            using the src attribute, acting like an element on the page, similar to a section of text. The
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>> tag in
            HTML can not have any child content either, as it doesn't have a closing tag because it is often formatted
            as follows: <code>&lt;img src="tree.jpg"&gt;</code>.

            The CSS property background-image puts an image onto the webpage as a background image of an element from
            the HTML, like a
        <div> tag. An image embedded by the background-image property is formatted like this: <code>background-image:
            url("tree.jpg");</code> An image put on the webpage using the <code>background-image</code> property can be
            manipulated by using
            other CSS properties like <code>background-position</code> which can choose how the background image is
            positioned on the
            page, like using <code>background-position: center;</code> to center the image in the element it is embedded
            in. Another
            property that can manipulate a <code>background-image</code> is <code>background-size</code>, which allows
            you to adjust the image's
            size within the element. For example, using <code>background-size: cover;</code> will cover the element with
            the entire
            image, rather than displaying a section or zoomed-in portion of the image.

            In a bitmap image, the dimensions are the width and the height of the image measured in pixels, while
            resolution is the ratio of pixels used in an image measured in pixels per inch.
