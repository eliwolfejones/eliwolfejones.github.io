        <h2>Color Used in CSS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>color: In CSS <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> is used to set the foreground color of an elementâ€™s text because the text is the main thing a section is showcasing. </li>
            <li>background-color: In CSS <code>&lt;background-color&gt;</code> is used to set the background color of an element, so the stuff behind the text or the space the element takes up. </li>
            <li>border-color: In CSS <code>&lt;border-color&gt;</code> is used to set the color of the border of the element, so the perimeter of the background, the edge of the space the element takes up. </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

        <h2>CSS Color Values</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Named: In CSS, when using the name of a color, it will set that part of the element to that color. For example, if the CSS code is <code>.section {color: blue;}</code> then the color of the text in each section would be blue. </li>
            <li>Hexadecimal: In CSS, hexadecimal is how specific colors are identified using a code of six numbers and/or letters. For example, if you want the background of a section to be a standard blue in hexadecimal, you would use the hex code #0000FF like this: <code>.section {background-color: #0000FF;}</code>. </li>
            <li>RGB: In CSS, RGB is the combination of a certain value of red, green and blue to make other colors. For example, if you wanted the border of your sections to be a standard blue using RGB, you would use the RGB value of 0, 0, 255 like this: <code>.section {border-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);}</code>. </li>
            <li>HSL: In CSS, HSL stands for hue saturation and lightness, and the combination of these can make every color. The way you use the value in CSS is similar but in tis case hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0-360, and saturation and lightness are both percentages. For example if you wanted the background of a section to be a standard blue you would put this: <code>{background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);}</code>. </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
