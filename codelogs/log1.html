	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>>

    <p>The difference between non-semantic and semantic tags and non-semantic tags is semantic tags defines the content it contains, example: &lt;img&gt;, and non-semantic tags tell the developer nothing about the content contained in the tag, example: &lt;div&gt;.</p>

    <p>Two benefits of using semantic tags are the developer can look back at old code and understand what the css code is directly affecting. It can also be beneficial when working with other people on a single website and when you show them your code they see semantic tags it will help them understand what each part of your code is doing, like making an image or an article.</p>
