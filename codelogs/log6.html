            The thing I looked up was HTML class attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used these four websites:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp ">W3schools</a>"</li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class ">MDN Web
                    Docs</a></li>
            <li><a
                    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79820631/creating-classes-class-objects-in-js-perhaps-jquery-not-sure">Stack
                    Overflow</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://devdocs.io/html/reference/global_attributes/class">DevDocs></a></li>
            </p>
    </section>

            The information about class attributes provided was similar, using an explanation of what class attributes
            are and giving example code on how they are used. Stack Overflow is for people who are asking questions
            about specific things, so the link is a question someone had about creating class objects in JavaScript. MDN
            gives one example of using class attributes and then some description of what class attributes are and how
            to use them. DevDocs does something similar where it uses one example which is very similar in format to
            MDN, giving the example then syntax, and then description. They also both give compatibility information.
            W3schools use more examples of code and the use of classes while they explain the examples between each of
            them. </p>
    
        <p>
            It seems to me that a good code website explains the code you want to know about, gives at least one example, and then goes into syntax and description. </p>

            <p>
All four of these websites are good and serve different purposes. I think if you want an explanation in words, you should use MDN or DevDocs. If you want a specific question answered, you should use Source Overflow. If you want a lot of examples on how that code is implemented and how it works, you should go to W3schools, which is my personal favorite because I like examples and don’t like reading wordy descriptions and explanations as much.             </p>
