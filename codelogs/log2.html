    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>

        <p>
            When talking about CSS length units there are two main types; absolute and relative. Absolute units are
            fixed,
            unchangins dimensions that remain constant regardless of screen size. For example, pixels (px), inches (in),
            centimeters (cm), and more. Relative units are flexible units that derive from the screen size the website
            is
            being displayed on. For example, em, rem, percentages (%), and more.

                <p>Let's look at px. Px stands for pixels which is an absolute unit meaning the amount of pixels you set
                    a picture or font size to be it will stay that way on every screen used to look at it.</p>
