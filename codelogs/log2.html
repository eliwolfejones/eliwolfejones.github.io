    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            When talking about CSS length units there are two main types; absolute and relative. Absolute units are
            fixed, unchanging dimensions that remain constant regardless of screen size. For example, pixels (px),
            inches (in), centimeters (cm), and more. Relative units are flexible units that derive from the size of
            other elements
            like the parent element or screen size. For example, em, rem, percentages (%), and more.

            <li>
                Let's look at px. Px stands for pixels which is an absolute unit meaning the amount of pixels you set
                a picture or font size to be it will stay that way no matter what sized screen you look at it with. For
                example if a font size is set to 50px it will be 50px on a phone, tablet, and computer.
            </li>
            On the contrary we have em which is a relative unit. Em is changed based on the font size of the parent
            element. So if a parent element has a font size of 16px and you set a child element to be 2em the child
            element will be 32px.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another relative unit is percentage (%). Percentage calculates the size of an elemant based on the size
                of the parent element. For example if the percentage of a div is set to 50% and the parent element is
                100px wide the div will be 50px wide.
