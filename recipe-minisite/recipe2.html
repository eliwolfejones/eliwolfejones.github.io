        <h1>Sugar Cookies</h1>
        <div id="cookie-image"></div>
        <p>This Sugar Cookie Recipe has been a crowd favorite for YEARS because it produces a consistent cookie with the perfect buttery flavor. These cookies hold their shape beautifully when cut with cookie cutters and one of the best things is that you can choose to bake these sugar cookies soft and thick, or thin and crisp and both ways are phenomenal!</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
               
                <h4>Make Dough</h4>
                 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start by beating your real butter and sugar and continue creaming for a full 2 minutes or so.  Your mixture will turn light and creamy in texture.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go.</li>
                        <li>Add egg and extract and mix to incorporate.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
                        <li>Slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until completely combined.  Your dough will first look crumbly, but keep mixing with a stand mixer and it will quickly turn into a soft cohesive dough.</li>
                        <li>You’ll need to chill your dough for about 1 hour. You can do so with dough gathered into one large mass, or use my preferred method which not only cuts down on chill time, but saves effort by rolling dough while it’s soft!</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Roll It Out</h4>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start by taking half (or all) of your dough and forming it into a rough ball and then flattening a little onto a silicone baking mat.  If you don’t have a silicone baking mat, you can use parchment or plastic wrap but they tend to slide around the counter so it just takes a little more effort.</li>
                        <li>Then place a piece of parchment paper (or plastic wrap) over your dough and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough between the baking mat and the parchment. This makes it so you can easily roll the dough with no flour needed, and nothing sticks to anything.</li>
                        <li>What I do next is pick up my silicone baking mat and flip the whole “package” over, so the parchment is on the counter, the dough in the middle, and the baking mat on top.  Peel off the baking mat and place your parchment and dough on a baking sheet that can now go in the fridge or freezer to chill. I put it on a baking sheet or directly onto a flat surface in the fridge or freezer.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Cut Your Shapes</h4>

                    <ol>
                        <li>This dough retains its shape incredibly well, just make sure it’s chilled.  I like to place mine in the freezer for 15 minutes or so, but you can also place it in the fridge. If you’ve used my method of rolling the dough out first, it needs far less time to chill. </li>
                        <li>Then cut out shapes and repeat the rolling process with the remaining dough. If you want super crisp edges on your finished baked cookies, you can even pull out your cutter again and re-cut when they are hot right out of the oven.</li>
                    </ol>
                   
                    <h4>Bake</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The great thing about this recipe is that you can roll these cookies thick and under-bake them and they will be crazy soft and delicious.  OR you can roll them thinner (&frac14; inch or less) and bake until you see the edges start turning golden brown and they are perfectly buttery-crisp on the edges.  Many recipes will simply be dry when baked till golden brown, but these are incredibly good- similar to a shortbread cookie that melts in your mouth.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Frosting Ideas</h4>

                    <ol>
                        <li>For straight up flavor, we love our Classic Buttercream Frosting on sugar cookies. It’s the most traditional combination!</li>
                        <li>If you’d like something a little more fun and artistic, try our popular Glace Icing and glaze.</li>
                        <li>And if you’d like to top them with royal icing, you can try my hand painted decorating technique!</li>
                    </ol>
